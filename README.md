# compareFiles

with this i can compare two proprietary-files.txt and show you the difference of missing blobs.

Clear files inside new.txt and old.txt

old one will be your working (might) p-files.txt

new one will be your newly extracted p-files.txt

Note: this script only compare two files and add missing files from old one only to output.txt.
